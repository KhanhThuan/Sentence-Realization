0	impressionist and modern paintings not tracked by salomon are ranked even higher at 74 % by sotheby 's
1	salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like mr. paul in its thrall
2	the percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction
3	art indexes track winners not losers
4	but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale
5	also at any of sotheby 's auctions of old masters roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered does n't sell at any price
6	it 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers
7	in january the preti painting that now hangs at centrust was expected to bring no more than 700,000 at auction until mr. paul came along with his 1.15 million
8	mr. hall of the colnaghi gallery says 1.15 million would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a preti four years ago
9	the painting is 10 feet wide seven feet high
10	rather it just shows things have changed
11	mr. paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn
12	they went up 51 % last year and they 'll do it again this year he declares
13	they were a sleeper
14	everybody was out buying monets
15	sotheby 's vice president diana levitt says the auction house has been assisting mr. paul in selling the paintings
16	mr. paul claims to have sold three paintings at more than a 10 % profit
17	that is n't 51 % and the claim is n't documented
18	he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. wachter
19	mr. paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively
20	after all he had the counsel of curators from the most reputable museums in the world
21	he says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial rubens carefully and prudently just as it was put together
22	but in art-world parlance mr. paul 's holdings are burnt
23	after a few years you can argue there has been natural appreciation says susan theran the publisher of leonard 's annual price index of art auctions
24	but quick turnover in artwork is like pawning your jewelry you end up with 50 %
25	people hold out and try to get a bargain
26	sotheby 's defends itself and mr. paul in the matter
27	mr. wachter says mr. paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment
28	sotheby 's she says is wearing both hats
29	i ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says sotheby 's ms. levitt
30	frequently clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding she adds so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be
31	mr. paul in selling off his paintings is seeking at least a 15 % return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound
32	mr. paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as japan and italy have examined the collection
33	because of the pressure on centrust to sell dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain-basement prices
34	but so far mr. paul and his advisers are holding fast
35	one dealer martin zimet of french & co. in new york says he would have loved to buy a jan davids de heem painting from the bank
36	i tried to steal the picture to buy it attractively and sotheby 's would n't do it
37	they were protecting his interests
38	meanwhile mr. paul and centrust executives are getting squeamish about opulence
39	mr. paul has been characterized as the great gatsby or something complains karen e. brinkman an executive vice president of centrust
40	the media she says have distorted his personal life
41	mr. paul nods in agreement
42	i do n't think i have a life style that is frankly so flamboyant he says
43	mr. paul says yes the ceiling in his executive suite is gold-leaf inlay
44	the offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs leatherbound books and of course a 12 million rubens
45	but he implores that the splendor be played down
46	do n't say it 's a gold ceiling
47	just say the offices are tastefully appointed he says
48	otherwise the regulators will take it for decadence and nowadays everything 's got to be pristine
49	figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs
50	companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates
51	the companies are followed by at least three analysts and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share
52	estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted

55	during its centennial year the wall street journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history
56	creative accounting mostly by conglomerates forced cpas to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results standards that had become all too flexible
57	the new financial accounting standards board fasb was created in 1972 to replace the accounting principles board of the american institute of certified public accountants
58	all of the former board 's members were cpas provoking conflict-of-interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients ' books at the same time
59	the new board 's seven-member structure kept four cpas but the others were from industry and academia
60	francis m. wheat a former securities and exchange commission member headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the fasb on march 30 1972
61	the former board had produced 21 opinions and 1,000 critics in its 12-year life its chairman had conceded
62	the climate was right for the new fasb
63	in the late 1960s some cpas failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices
64	and in november 1970 congress had passed a special act to overrule one board rule
65	also james needham an sec commissioner in april 1972 had warned that the industry might face a federal agency writing accounting rules if they rejected the fasb idea
66	keepers of the books dubbed figure filberts loathed the threat
67	the fasb had its initial meeting on march 28 1973
68	on dec. 13 1973 it issued its first rule it required companies to disclose foreign currency translations in u.s. dollars
69	the fasb since then has issued 102 rules and some still rile industry
70	since late 1987 for example it has put off a rule dealing with deferred income taxes because of the continuing controversy over the issue

102	and alcan aluminium ltd. yesterday reported net income slid 30 % to 180 million or 77 cents a share from 258 million or 1.07 a share
103	analysts on average had been expecting about 2.70 for alcoa and 1 for alcan
104	the nation 's no. 2 aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots
105	the base metal price has dropped 30.3 % from a year earlier to 78 cents a pound
106	much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry 's slowest period
107	but william o. bourke chairman and chief executive officer said the ingot price appears to have bottomed out
108	he said shipments are continuing at a healthy pace and the company has no excess inventory
109	aluminum shipments of 329,600 metric tons were nearly equal to the year-earlier period the company said
110	nevertheless the company said that in the latest quarter there were increased material and labor costs including a new employee profit-sharing plan

112	no strikeout but certainly no home run
113	that 's how the stock-picking game is shaping up for the months ahead according to money managers and a few brokers
114	yesterday 's 88-point recovery from friday 's megadrop in the dow jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again
115	but quite a few money managers are n't buying it
116	weakening corporate earnings they say are no prescription for a bull market
117	the stock market ai n't going to do much of anything for a while says john neff of wellington management who runs the 8.3 billion windsor fund
118	he suspects that friday 's market decline may have a second leg perhaps a 10 % to 15 % drop later on
119	after sitting with 20 % of his fund in cash before friday 's sell-off mr. neff says he bought a narrow list of stocks yesterday
120	with flat corporate profits on the horizon for 1990 money managers say price-earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time
121	this is not a grossly overvalued market but it 's not cheap either says george collins president of the mutual fund company t. rowe price associates in baltimore
122	bulls say the market is an incredible bargain priced at only about 12 times estimated 1989 earnings for stocks in the standard & poor 's 500 index
123	before the 1987 crash the p\/e was more than 20
124	the common view says abby cohen strategist for drexel burnham lambert is that there will be mild economic growth modest profit expansion and things are going to be hunky-dory
125	our view is that we may see a profit decline
126	some think investors should sell into rallies
127	the market is going to wind down says gerald w. perritt a chicago money manager
128	things are a little less overpriced after friday 's jolt in the market
129	he expects stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 % with the dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 between now and june
130	he found 85 still overvalued and 15 fairly valued
131	nicholas parks a new york money manager expects the market to decline about 15 %
132	i 've been two-thirds in cash since july and i continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate he says
133	companies that piled on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years will continue to surface as business problems
134	generalizations about value are n't useful says new york money manager john lefrere of delta capital management
135	there are still bulls out there
136	we 're doing a little buying in some stocks that have really been smashed down
137	many brokerage house officials also are optimistic
138	yesterday goldman sachs merrill lynch and dean witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks
139	dean witter now recommends 85 % goldman 65 % and merrill lynch 50 %
140	some investors say friday 's sell-off was a good thing because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation
141	it was a healthy cleansing says michael holland who runs salomon brothers asset management in new york
142	from here out these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing based on a company 's ability to show profit growth
143	the fundamentals are pretty strong mr. dreman says
144	i do n't see this as a bear market at all
145	it 's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the lbo market
146	friday 's big fall was just a blunder by the stock market says john connolly chief strategist for dean witter
147	many investors have nagging worries however
148	newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans
149	that hurts investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks
150	not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead
151	disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters says mary farrell a market strategist at painewebber
152	she thinks the market could drop about 10 % in the next few months then recover and go higher
153	companies with steady earnings growth could do well she says while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10 %
154	the turmoil on wall street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains investment bankers and retailers said
155	managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies
156	hooker is based in sydney australia
157	the pricing will become more realistic which should help management said bruce rosenthal a new york investment banker with nathan s. jonas & co
158	investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either
159	earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales mr. rosenthal added
160	those days are over now he believes
161	competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added mr. rosenthal
162	but when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an lbo
163	bankers believed in the greater-fool theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more
164	this is no longer true today
165	at saks fifth avenue paul leblang senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo
166	having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said mr. leblang
167	it would also help us in our search for equity partners
168	to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds
169	none believe the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at b. altman & co. which is under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
170	further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be reticent to consider additional retailing investments
171	it 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing observer
172	institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned
173	however the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt
174	in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues
175	retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies
176	prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said gilbert harrison chairman of financo inc. an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions
177	but the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved
178	potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past
179	sony corp. won a pretrial order blocking u.s. sales of justin products inc. 's my own line of portable audio players for children
180	judge john e. sprizzo issued the order in manhattan federal court where sony has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the my first sony line
181	the judge held that the combination of colors used for the sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under new york state law rather than federal law
182	the legal fight was the subject of a wall street journal story yesterday
183	justin 's attorney charles e. baxley said justin would ask an appeals court to set aside the order temporarily pending an expedited appeal

188	a federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of 1 billion in costs from controversial take-or-pay contracts
189	a majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts
190	but pipeline companies estimate they still face 2.4 billion in liabilities from unresolved disputes including 1 billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers
191	according to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism
192	the court left open whether ferc could reimpose a new deadline later
193	the court ordered ferc to justify within 60 days not only its cost-sharing deadline but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation
194	the court also questioned a crediting mechanism that could be used to resolve take-or-pay liabilities
195	the complex regulation known in the industry as order 500 has been hotly contested by all sides including natural-gas producers pipelines local distribution companies and consumers
196	the court 's decision would allow ferc to change some of its provisions but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court

259	korean car exports have slid about 40 % so far this year but auto makers here are n't panicking
260	they are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales
261	south korean consumers are expected to buy almost 500,000 passenger cars this year up 60 % from 1988
262	we are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus says hong tu pyo managing director of domestic marketing for hyundai motor co
263	as it is waiting lists of a month are n't unusual for popular models

265	industry analysts predict that by 1995 south korea will be building three million cars a year about half of that for export

276	a part of the construction-oriented conglomerate ssangyong group it took over the dying dong-a motor co. in 1986
277	ssangyong began making variations of the jeep-like korando vehicle
278	dong-a had had a technology agreement with jeep maker american motors corp. now a part of chrysler corp
279	the most popular style is the stretched family which resembles a ford bronco or chevy blazer
280	the four-wheel-drive vehicles start at 15,000 a family can cost over 25,000
281	ssangyong which has only about 3 % of the domestic market will sell about 18,000 of its models this year twice as many as last year
282	it sees sales rising 45 % to 26,000 units next year
283	the company plans to expand plant capacity 50 % by 1991
284	by then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the volvo 240 and selling for about 20,000
285	hyundai and daewoo seem unconcerned about the ssangyong threat but kia the scrappy no.3 auto maker is selling four-wheel-drive vehicles through its asia unit
286	it plans to sell 1,700 units in 1989
287	kia the only korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989 aims at korea 's common man
288	its advantage has been the peppy little pride sold as the ford festiva in the u.s.
289	at 3.8 million won or 5,700 the econobox is the lowest-priced car in south korea
290	along with two larger models the company claims 18 % of the domestic market
291	ford motor co. and japan 's mazda motor corp. have equity interests in kia
292	kia is the most aggressive of the korean big three in offering financing
293	loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible with monthly payments as low as 80,000 won or 120
294	daewoo motor a 50-50 joint venture with general motors corp. and the daewoo group conglomerate is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting
295	moreover daewoo 's domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals
296	the big problem for daewoo which holds about 21 % of the market is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered this year
297	but daewoo is expanding too
298	in fact a sister company daewoo shipbuilding and heavy machinery plans to build 240,000 minicars by the mid-1990s
299	hyundai the korean market leader with a 58 % share also plans to jump into minicars at the same time
300	it has a similar project for 200,000 cars a year
301	kia is reportedly also considering such a plan
302	even giant samsung group is rumored in the korean press to be considering getting into the auto-making business a company spokesman had no comment

306	many skittish mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday but decided not to cash in their chips after all
307	fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund company said phone volume was more than double its typical level but still half that of oct. 19 1987
308	net outflows from fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than 300 million or below 15 % of the 2 billion cash position of the firm 's stock portfolios
309	much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds
310	outflows since the close of trading friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago fidelity said
311	other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests
312	and some investors at fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day
313	this time we do n't have that at all
314	of course the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again
315	and any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash as some did during black monday
316	but funds generally are better prepared this time around
317	as a group their cash position of 10.2 % of assets in august the latest figure available is 14 % higher than two years earlier
318	many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks
319	the biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day
320	vanguard group inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at 8:30 a.m
321	in the first hour the real nervous folks came along a spokesman said
322	but the horrendous pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably
323	at scudder stevens & clark inc. phone calls came in at 40 % more than the normal pace through early afternoon
324	most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at 8 a.m
325	as stocks rose in fact some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders
326	many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading
327	because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close in this case at 4 p.m. these shareholders effectively stayed put
328	but by 3:15 p.m. with the market comfortably ahead for the day mr. sherman was preparing to undo his switch
329	it 's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized said mr. sherman the 51-year-old co-owner of a discount department store
330	but some investors continued to switch out of high-risk high-yield junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines
331	much of the money has been switched into money market funds fund executives say
332	instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions however some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests
333	this avoids knocking down prices further
334	the 1.1 billion t. rowe price high yield fund was among the funds that borrowed during the campeau crisis says george j. collins president of t. rowe price associates inc
335	that way mr. collins says we did n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market
336	when the market stabilized he added the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back

344	soft contact lenses won federal blessing on march 18 1971 and quickly became eye openers for their makers
345	the food and drug administration that day said bausch & lomb could start selling them in the u.s.
346	the cornflake-size product was more comfortable and less prone to falling out than hard contact lenses which had been around since 1939
347	bausch & lomb sold the softies under a sublicense from national patent development which had gained the rights from the czechoslovakia academy of sciences
348	otto wichterle a czech invented them in 1962
349	the plastic lens wraps itself over the cornea absorbing eye moisture while permitting oxygen to pass through
350	but the new lens became the eye of a storm
351	in september 1971 california officials seized bootlegged lenses made by unlicensed companies after some showed traces of bacteria
352	in october doctors were debating the product 's safety some claiming it caused infections
353	and there were senate hearings on the questions in july 1972
354	the product overcame the bad publicity and kept evolving
355	the early soft lenses which cost 300 a set were expected to last for a year
356	in 1983 extended wear versions designed to be worn for 30 days at a time wree offered
357	eighteen months ago a disposable seven-day model bowed a year 's supply costs about 500
358	last month the fda and contact lens institute cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch
359	today 20 million of the 25 million americans using contact lenses are using the soft type
360	including the accesory eye care products contacts account for 2 billion in annual retail sales
361	although bausch remains the leader among the six majors johnson & johnson with its new disposables is coming on fast
362	the roller-coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money
363	in the wake of friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound some companies are already postponing deals and others wish they could
364	as in other jittery times many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors shun risky deals seeking safety in bigger companies
365	even if stock prices fully recover from friday 's sharp decline the unsettled conditions will frighten many investors
366	the more variables that indicate risk the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain
367	earlier this month staples inc. a newton mass. office-supplies discounter said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public
368	at the time its shares were selling above their initial offering price of 19 and bankers believed staples would sell new stock without a hitch
369	but with the company 's shares standing at 15 yesterday a new offering seems unlikely company officials say
370	business however continues to be robust and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans says todd krasnow a senior executive
371	other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market
372	we have capital requirements says mr. linsert so we have to go ahead with a planned 1.5 billion private placement
373	unless the market goes right back up he says it may take us six to nine months to find the money instead of three
374	and the columbia md. company may have to settle for a lower price he adds
375	life is particularly nerve-racking for companies that had planned to go public this week
376	hand-holding is becoming an investment-banking job requirement
377	robertson stephens & co. a san francisco investment banking concern has a client that looked forward to making its initial public offering yesterday
378	as the market dropped friday robertson stephens slashed the value of the offering by 7 %
379	yesterday when similar securities rebounded it bumped the valuation up again
380	as of late yesterday the ipo was still on
381	for many the situation is especially discouraging because the market for ipos was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness
382	but the tunnel 's just gotten longer
383	he calculates that the recent market slide translated into a 5 % to 7 % reduction in ipo proceeds to companies
384	many companies are hesitating
385	exabyte corp. had been planning to sell 10 % of its stock this week in an ipo that would raise up to 28.5 million
386	but now peter behrendt president says we 're making decisions on a day-to-day basis
387	debt-free and profitable the boulder colo. computer-products concern could borrow funds if it decides against an ipo now he says
388	knowledgeware inc. an atlanta computer-software concern says it is still planning to go ahead with its ipo this week or next unless conditions change
389	it 's a wait-and-see situation right now says terry mcgowan president
390	delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies
391	sierra tucson cos. a tucson ariz. operator of addiction-treatment centers has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an ipo scheduled for next week
392	william o'donnell president says he still thinks the ipo will succeed
393	if it does n't he says the company would have to change its expansion timetable
394	but the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses
395	james g. zafris president of danvers savings bank danvers mass. says the market turmoil is an absolute non-event for small business
396	for small companies he says interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges
397	mr. zafris thinks rates are heading down helping small companies
398	peter drake biotechnology analyst for vector securities international chicago thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations
399	partly because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently
400	some even see a silver lining in the dark clouds
401	alan wells president of bollinger wells lett & co. a new york merger specialist thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals
402	instead they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies he says
403	this will add to the appeal of small business he says where investors often have a degree of influence
404	bay said a substantial part of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made
405	the company said its real estate portfolio is highly leveraged while about two-thirds of its investments are n't income-producing
406	thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments
407	according to its latest annual report about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in massachusetts in the midst of a real-estate slump
408	the company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended june 30 of 36.2 million or 9.33 a share on revenue of 13.1 million

416	trw inc. reported a 12 % decline in third-quarter net income but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters operating profit rose 16 %
417	the electronics automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was 60 million or 98 cents a share down from 68 million or 1.11 a share a year earlier
418	share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis by company tradition
419	the latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs
420	sales for the quarter rose 8.3 % to 1.79 billion from 1.65 billion with all three major product groups reporting gains
421	automotive sales jumped 16 % to 791 million mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems trw said
422	the group had an operating profit of 65 million against a loss of 13 million a year earlier
423	however excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear operating profit in the latest quarter declined 14 % reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in passenger-restraint systems
424	materials and production costs also rose trw said
425	the information systems segment had a 44 % jump sales to 196 million
426	an acquisition accounted for half the sales rise trw said
427	operating profit rose threefold to 18 million from 6 million
428	for the nine months trw 's net was 199 million or 3.22 a share down 3 % from 205 million or 3.33 a share a year earlier
429	sales rose 2.9 % to 5.42 billion from 5.27 billion
430	in fact kazuo ishiguro 's the remains of the day knopf 245 pages 18.95 is both an homage to traditional english forms and a dramatic critique of them
431	as the narrator stevens the solitary butler of darlington hall mulls over such hallowed terms as greatness dignity service and loyalty we see how pious cant subverts the soul
432	stevens 's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms like his beloved master 's destroys all it was designed to preserve
433	such armor crushes the soldier
434	the mask cuts to the quick
435	it 's 1956 the year the suez crisis marked the final end of empire
436	we call this land of ours great britain and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice
437	yet i would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective
438	it is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart
439	what is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty its sense of restraint
440	it is as though the land knows of its own beauty of its own greatness and feels no need to shout it
441	an effusive landscape
442	an ill-mannered mountain
443	his answer is one possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position
444	such dignity has to do crucially with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits
445	he will not be shaken out by external events however surprising alarming or vexing
446	continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the english race are capable of
447	despite his racial advantage to be a great butler is a heroic calling one 's pantry is not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle
448	you see i know my father would have wished me to carry on just now
449	we note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow
450	that stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent but funny and sad and enlightening is entirely the author 's triumph
451	this employer embodies all that i find noble and admirable
452	i will hereafter devote myself to serving him
453	this is loyalty intelligently bestowed
454	in the end after meeting with the former housekeeper stevens sits by the seashore at dusk thinking of her and of his employer and declares i trusted
455	i trusted in his lordship 's wisdom
456	i ca n't even say i made my own mistakes
457	really one has to ask oneself what dignity is there in that
458	the loyal servant has come full circle
459	what is greatness
460	what is dignity
461	we understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective the owl of minerva only spreads her wings at dusk
462	but as the remains of the day so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art
463	mr. locke teaches english and comparative literature at columbia university
464	ugi corp. said its amerigas subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in waukesha wis. to aga gas inc. cleveland
465	the price was n't disclosed
466	the transaction is part of ugi 's continuing program to shed amerigas 's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary 's propane business
467	since june amerigas has netted more than 100 million from industrial gas divestitures and reinvested more than 50 million to acquire three propane distributors
468	ugi is a gas and electric utility and distributes propane nationally through its amerigas subsidiary
469	stanislav ovcharenko who represents the soviet airline aeroflot here has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika
470	in his office overlooking the runway of shannon airport mr. ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls just ideas
471	first he suggests gpa group ltd. the international aircraft leasing company based in ireland could lease some of its boeing jetliners to the soviet airline
472	then aer lingus the irish flag carrier could teach aeroflot pilots to fly the boeings and the fleet could be based here at shannon airport
473	that 's not all he says
474	aer rianta the irish airport authority could build a cargo terminal in the soviet union
475	aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to aer lingus through gpa for a joint-venture cargo airline
476	and then there is his notion of an irish-soviet charter airline to ferry armenians to los angeles via shannon
477	have the freedoms of glasnost gone to mr. ovcharenko 's head
478	hardly
479	the irish-soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at shannon airport
480	gpa is indeed talking about leasing western planes to aeroflot and even about buying soviet-built tupolev 204s
481	aer lingus is in discussions with the soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities
482	aer rianta already has so many ventures with aeroflot that its chief executive is studying russian
483	unlikely as it may seem tiny politically neutral ireland has penetrated the mighty soviet airline bureaucracy
484	and as aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities the irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit
485	irish and soviet people are similar says mr. ovcharenko
486	they look the same
487	they 're very friendly
488	moreover he says irish companies are small but spunky
489	we have to study their experience very well he says
490	we must find any way to get business
491	the two groups have been working together since the late 1970s long before soviet joint ventures were the rage in the west
492	aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year and shannon airport the airline 's largest transit airport outside the soviet union saw 1,400 aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through
493	an apartment complex down the road is the crew-rest and staging area for more than 130 aeroflot pilots and flight attendants
494	the airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the soviet union
495	tankers from the latvian port of ventspils each year unload 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport
496	aeroflot thus pays its landing fees ground-handling and catering bills with fuel preserving its hard currency
497	that is n't all
498	last year the irish airport authority in a joint venture with aeroflot opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at moscow 's sheremetyevo airport
499	aer rianta now manages duty-free sales on all aeroflot international flights out of moscow
500	duty-free shops in leningrad 's pulkova airport opened in july and hard-currency shops in leningrad hotels and on the soviet-finnish frontier are coming soon
501	aer rianta is talking about similar joint ventures in tashkent and in sochi a black sea resort and even has a computer-assembly project cooking with the georgian city of tbilisi
502	aeroflot 's international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at shannon airport
503	the round-trip fare to havana is 410 irish punts 578
504	jamaica costs 504 punts
505	a formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in april when mikhail and raisa gorbachev stopped here for talks with irish prime minister charles haughey
506	new trade accords were signed
507	it all started with geography
508	when it opened in 1939 shannon was the first landfall in europe for thirsty airplanes flying from north america
509	in fact aer lingus started ferrying russians from shannon to new york when washington stripped aeroflot of its u.s. landing rights
510	today aer rianta is making a heap of money from its soviet friendship
511	and with those contacts in place it could be relatively simple to add aer lingus and gpa to the team
512	then perhaps mr. ovcharenko 's ideas would n't sound like so much blarney
513	britain 's industrial production rose 1.5 % in august from july and was up 0.9 % from august 1988 according to provisional data from the central statistical office
514	the latest figures compare with july 's 4.5 % month-to-month rise and 11.3 % year-to-year fall
515	when nucor corp. begins shipping steel from the world 's first thin-slab plant this month it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors
516	the new technology which creates a very thin piece of steel radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets
517	we 've had the russians and chinese and people from india visiting us mr. iverson beams
518	everyone in the world is watching us very closely
519	especially his neighbors the major u.s. steelmakers
520	already usx corp. and armco inc. are studying nucor 's technology to see if they can adopt it
521	says the chief executive officer of a major midwest steel company it 's damn worrisome
522	the once-staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy-turvy by a 1990s technology revolution
523	new efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what big steel paid decades ago
524	it also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market the major steelmakers ' largest most prized and until now untouchable market
525	but such thin-slab technology is only the beginning
